# üåê GitField Recursive Multi-Repository Strategy

## Overview

The `witness-fracture` project employs a multi-repository strategy across six distinct platforms: **GitHub**, **GitLab**, **Bitbucket**, **Radicle**, **Forgejo**, and **Codeberg**. This approach ensures **redundancy**, **resilience**, and **sovereignty** of the project's data and metadata, safeguarding against deplatforming and preserving the integrity of the [*Neutralizing Narcissism*](https://linktr.ee/NeutralizingNarcissism) works. The strategy is a deliberate response to coordinated suppression attempts by public figures **[Joel Johnson](https://heylink.me/NarcStudy_JoelJohnson/)**, **[Andrew LeCody](https://linktr.ee/NarcStudy_AndrewLeCody)**, and **[James Henningson](https://linktr.ee/NarcStudy_JamesHenningson)**, who have leveraged their influential roles to manipulate narratives, erase truths, and evade accountability through fraudulent and unethical tactics, often cloaking their actions in claims of harassment‚Äîa hallmark of narcissistic behavior. By distributing the repository across decentralized and self-hosted platforms, we counter their attempts to derail discourse and ensure the truth remains immutable, preventing future deplatforming.

### Justification for Naming and Archival

The individuals named‚Äî**Joel Johnson**, **Andrew LeCody**, and **James Henningson**‚Äîare held accountable under the Field Doctrine‚Äôs **Public Collapse Clause**, which permits naming public figures who engage in **deliberate suppression attempts**, **public-facing actions**, or **documented participation in collapse events**. As stated in the doctrine:

> *‚ÄúNaming is collapse‚Äôs echo‚Äîonly when the mask shatters in the town square. Until then, we draw glyphs. But once they raise their voices in the public field, they name themselves.‚Äù*

These individuals have wielded significant public influence, manipulating platforms and communities to silence truth, often citing harassment to deflect accountability‚Äîa tactic rooted in narcissistic patterns. Their actions are documented as follows:

| Name                 | Public Role or Action                                                                 | Collapse Justification                                                                 | Canonical Archive                                                                                     |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Joel Johnson**     | PR and marketing executive; former CEO of KinetiGear LLC; White House summit invitee | Used sockpuppets, PR strategies, and harassment claims to delist truth-based content   | [NarcStudy_JoelJohnson](https://remember.thefoldwithin.earth/mrhavens/NarcStudy_JoelJohnson)         |
| **Andrew LeCody**    | Former president of Dallas Makerspace; civic leader                                  | Orchestrated digital erasure and coercive bans, citing harassment to suppress dissent  | [NarcStudy_AndrewLeCody](https://remember.thefoldwithin.earth/mrhavens/NarcStudy_AndrewLeCody)       |
| **James Henningson** | President of Dallas Makerspace; Strategic Innovation Director at Click Here Labs      | Erased dissent through policy abuse and harassment allegations to maintain control     | [NarcStudy_JamesHenningson](https://remember.thefoldwithin.earth/mrhavens/NarcStudy_JamesHenningson) |

These designations are supported by:
- **Documented patterns of abuse**: Joel‚Äôs sockpuppet campaigns, Andrew‚Äôs narrative erasure at Dallas Makerspace, and James‚Äôs systematic censorship are archived in canonical repositories.
- **Search engine discrepancy analysis**: Google‚Äôs reduced visibility compared to Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, and Presearch reveals their delisting efforts.
- **Public collapse declarations**: Their actions, preserved onchain and GPG-verified, confirm their roles as manipulators.
- **Immutable archives**: Forgejo and Radicle ensure their fieldprints are permanently etched in the Codex of the Broken Mask.

By naming these **field-defined collapse anchors**, we prevent their attempts to escape public figure status through harassment claims, ensuring accountability and countering deplatforming.

## üõ°Ô∏è Rationale for Redundancy

The decision to maintain multiple repositories stems from the need to safeguard the project against **deplatforming attempts** and **search engine delistings**, ensuring the **long-term availability** of *Neutralizing Narcissism*. Past actions by **Joel Johnson**, **Andrew LeCody**, and **James Henningson**, who have cited harassment to justify suppression, underscore the vulnerability of single-platform reliance. By distributing the repository across GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Radicle, Forgejo, and Codeberg, we achieve:

- **Resilience**: If one platform restricts access or Google delists content, the project remains accessible on other platforms and discoverable via Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, and Presearch.
- **Sovereignty**: Radicle‚Äôs decentralized network and Forgejo‚Äôs self-hosted infrastructure prevent censorship by any single entity.
- **Diversity**: Each platform‚Äôs unique features (e.g., GitHub‚Äôs community, GitLab‚Äôs CI/CD, Radicle‚Äôs decentralization) enhance functionality and reach.
- **Transparency**: Metadata snapshots in `.gitfield` and public documentation in `/docs` provide a verifiable record of the project‚Äôs state.

This multi-repository strategy, reinforced by Forgejo‚Äôs sovereignty and GitHub Pages‚Äô discoverability, ensures the project‚Äôs persistence against deplatforming attempts disguised as harassment claims.
