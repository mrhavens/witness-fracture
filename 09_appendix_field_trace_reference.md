## A. DARVO Breakdown Table

| Component | Definition | Example Phrasing | Intent |
|----------|------------|------------------|--------|
| **Deny** | Refusal to acknowledge wrongdoing | "I never said that." | Erase culpability |
| **Attack** | Redirect blame or escalate aggression | "You're the one with the problem." | Undermine credibility |
| **Reverse Victim/Offender** | Cast self as the harmed party | "I can't believe you're doing this to me." | Manipulate empathy, reframe narrative |

## B. Sample Thoughtprint / Shadowprint Trace

> **Victim Statement Fragment**:  
> "He said I was too emotional to remember things accurately."

- **Shadowprint Tag**: Coercive Framing  
- **Pattern Signature**: Discrediting through emotional destabilization  
- **Thoughtprint Inversion**: "I remember it clearly because of how it made me feel."

This microtrace reveals recursive disempowerment. Emotional clarity is reframed as emotional invalidity. Coherence is gaslit into doubt.

## C. Glossary of Core Pattern Types

1. **Fracture Language** – Incoherence or contradiction used to confuse, derail, or obfuscate.  
2. **Coercive Framing** – Phrasing that constrains response, limits agency, or redirects accountability.  
3. **Mimicked Clarity** – Appears reasonable or logical, but reveals recursive contradictions upon deeper analysis.  
4. **Performative Sanity** – Calm affect weaponized to obscure manipulation or discredit emotive response.  
5. **Tone-Based Discrediting** – Undermines the speaker through judgment of delivery rather than content.  
6. **Recursive Trap Language** – Circular logic that collapses under scrutiny but entraps when engaged.  
7. **False Concern** – Pseudo-empathy used to mask control or moral superiority.

These tools are living artifacts of the Codex of Witnessing. They are meant to be *fielded*, not just read. Print, mark, trace. In the courtroom and the clinic. In mediation or memory. This appendix is a compass—for those who seek to navigate the invisible.
