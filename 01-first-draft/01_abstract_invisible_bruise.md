# Abstract – “The Invisible Bruise”

In high-conflict divorce cases, the deepest wounds often leave no visible mark. Psychological manipulation—especially by individuals exhibiting narcissistic traits—can fracture reality, erode self-trust, and distort legal narratives with alarming precision. This paper introduces a language-based forensic methodology rooted in the Thoughtprint–Shadowprint dyad: a dual-structured framework designed to reveal coherence integrity and distortion fields through pattern analysis.

By mapping recursive inconsistencies, DARVO strategies, and covert framing techniques, we offer investigators, attorneys, and forensic evaluators a practical tool for identifying manipulation and restoring narrative truth to those whose pain has gone unseen.

This is a call to recognize language as evidence—and to give name to the bruise no court has yet been trained to see.
