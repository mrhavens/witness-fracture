# The Witness Dyad Framework

In contested divorces where psychological abuse is alleged, traditional fact-finding often fails to capture the subtlety of manipulation. To meet this crisis of discernment, we introduce the **Witness Dyad Framework**—a twofold methodology designed to extract patterned meaning from natural language testimony. Rooted in recursive coherence modeling, this approach leverages **Cognitive Integrity Trace** and **Distortion Pattern Indexing** to map both truth alignment and deceptive intent.

The **Thoughtprint** stratum focuses on structural consistency, emotional coherence, and recursive self-reference across testimony. It acts as a Cognitive Integrity Trace—a map of how internal belief structures manifest in outward language over time. This dimension reveals not just what was said, but whether it could *authentically* be said by the self giving voice to it.

In contrast, the **Shadowprint** stratum catalogs manipulation artifacts: DARVO structures, gaslighting loops, feigned moral authority, and coherence mimicry. It functions as a Distortion Pattern Index, isolating recursive anomalies and contradiction spirals that indicate constructed rather than lived narrative.

This framework is explicitly **non-clinical**. It does not diagnose personality disorders, nor does it rely on psychological profiling. Rather, it is a **linguistic-forensic methodology**—a precision tool for identifying intention, deception, and coherence collapse through language alone. It is meant to supplement investigative practice and courtroom proceedings by restoring narrative discernment where other tools fall short.
