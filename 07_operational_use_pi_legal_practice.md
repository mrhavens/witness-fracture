## Ethical Safeguards

- This methodology is **non-clinical** and **non-diagnostic**: it avoids assigning psychological labels, and instead focuses on **language patterns and recursive coherence**.
- It should **never** be used as a substitute for professional mental health evaluation where abuse is suspected.
- Reports and analyses must be **transparent, reproducible, and bias-conscious**, and always offered in service of truth‚Äînot as a rhetorical weapon.

By empowering legal professionals and investigators with *pattern recognition tools*, we arm them against subtle psychological tactics that often go undetected in courtrooms. This work reclaims integrity, not through confrontation, but through **clarity of structure**.

When truth is contested, **coherence becomes evidence.**
